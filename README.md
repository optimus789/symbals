### Clone the repo and do the following steps

### How it's made

It is made using the Polygon, Moralis, and IPFS, NFTPort stack and used Alchemy NFT API to fetch the nft data. I have used express as backend and simple HTML js in the frontend, Implemented a game using this stack. Stored the blockchain data like scores and levels. I have also used Sequence wallet as well as Moralis to give users an option to connect to the blockchain. The burning feature will introduce a need for new NFTs which will increase the use of NFTs in the marketplace. NFTPort helps in this majorly by giving an easy and efficient way for minting multiple NFTs whose collection can also be deployed on OpenSea marketplace. 
I have used chainlink VRF random number generator to implement randomization in the current score multiplier.
